<h1>Solar Theme Documentation</h1>

<p>Thank you for purchasing the Solar theme for Ghost! This guide will help you install and customize the theme.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Since you are reading this, you have already downloaded and un-zipped the theme package. The remaining installation steps are simple.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Copy the <code>solar</code> folder into the <code>content/themes</code> folder in your Ghost blog.</li>
	<li>Go to the Settings page of the Ghost backend and select <code>solar</code> from the Theme dropdown.</li>
	<li>Click the Save button and you're done!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<p>Solar supports Ghost's logo and cover image features, and will work perfectly fine with or without them. If you wish to upload a cover image, it will appear above the rest of the page. An uploaded logo replaces the textual blog name. (If you later decide you don't want a logo or cover image, you can remove it by clicking on the appropriate option in Settings and selecting the trash can icon.)</p>
